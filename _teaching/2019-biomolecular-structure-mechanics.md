The main focus of this course is on the molecular interactions defining the structure, dynamics and function of biological systems. The principal experimental and computational techniques used in structural biology, as well as molecular modeling and design, were introduced and practiced.
In my role I guided the students through the practical laboratories, and supervised them during the course of short 3-months projects. I also evaluated their final tests.
