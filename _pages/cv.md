Work experience
======
## Chemical Data Scientist - [Synple Chem](https://www.synplechem.com/) (Zurich, Switzerland)
*08-2025 → present*

Symple Chem develops automated technology for small molecule synthesis.

**Key responsibilities:**
 - Build and validate predictive models for chemical reactivity and solubility (both physics-based and ML-based)
 - Integrate model outputs into automated synthesis workflows

## Drug Hunter / Computational Chemist - [Aqemia](https://www.aqemia.com/) (Paris, France)
*02-2022 → 07-2025*

Aqemia is a pharmatech startup that leverages machine learning and molecular models to expedite the drug discovery process and generate novel drug candidates.

**Key responsibilities:**
 - Participate in early stage drug discovery projects, i.e. searching novel small molecules for medical targets, by means of protein modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and similar computational methods. Usage of structure-based approaches and evaluation of protein-ligand interactions
 - Oversee initiatives focused on enhancing the company's technological capabilities, with a specific emphasis on the automation and scalability of analyses that traditionally necessitate direct human involvement. Examples of such analyses include evaluation of molecular dynamics trajectories and assessment of the quality of ligand poses

## Postdoctoral Researcher - [Computer-aided Molecular Engineering group](https://www.unil.ch/dof/en/home/menuinst/research-labs/zoete.html) (Lausanne, Switzerland)
*11-2020 → 01-2022*

Supervisor: [Prof. Vincent Zoete](https://www.sib.swiss/vincent-zoete-group)

**Key responsibilities:**
 - Exploit the usage of interaction fingerprints to recapitulate protein-ligand interactions and use them to post-process docking outputs and analyse the quality of ligand poses
 - Use the Rosetta software suite to generate a scoring method to evaluate the specificity of pMHC sequences towards T-cell Receptors

## Graduate Researcher - [Laboratory for Biomolecular Modeling](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lbm/) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
*01-2015 → 10-2015*

Supervisor: [Prof. Matteo Dal Peraro](https://people.epfl.ch/matteo.dalperaro?lang=en)

**Key responsibilities:**

Structural characterization of two peripheral membrane proteins, respectively involved in antibiotic multiresistance (NDM-1) and cancer (Golph3). In details:
  - Characterize the membrane binding mechanism of the 2 proteins
  - Assess the molecular bases that determine the different functional behaviour of homologous proteins
  - Identify potential allosteric sites
  - Use the computational data to propose validation experiments

Assist numerous experimental projects with molecular modeling, in particular:
  - Provide molecular explanations of high-level experimental observations (ex: viral capsids thermostability, ligand selectivity, etc.)
  - Test hypothesis that origin from wet-lab experiments

## Research Assistant at the [Computational Biophysics group](https://m3.dti.supsi.ch/) at University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (Lugano, Switzerland)
*01-2013 → 12-2014*

Supervisor: [Prof. Andrea Danani](https://www.supsi.ch/en/andrea-danani)

**Key responsibilities:**
 - Contribution to multiple structure-based drug discovery projects
 - Conduct mechanistic studies to characterize the mechanism of action of 2 classes of pro-inflammatory drugs targeting TLR7
 - Supervise a project aimed at enhancing the potency of an inverse agonist of the human growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R)

## Visiting student at the [Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/li-ka-shing-institute-virology/index.html) at University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada
*04-2012 → 10-2012*

Supervisors: [Prof. Michael Houghton](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/mhoughto), [Prof. Jack Tuszynski](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/jackt)

**Key responsibilities:**
Final project of Master studies performed at the Laboratory of Prof. Michael Houghton (Nobel Prize laureate in Physiology or Medicine, 2020).
 - Implement a computational method to automatize the search for potential inhibitors of NS5B, a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the hepatitis C virus
 - Learn usage of molecular docking, homology modelling, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations
